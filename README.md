# Who am I?

Greetings🖖! I am a freshman in the B.S. in Computer Science program at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. **My main passion is creating robust, appealing, and reliable software that put smiles on people's faces.** 

I mainly work with web development and artificial intelligence/machine learning, but I have also built iOS apps, 2D/3D games, bots, and mathematical simulations. Outside of the technical domain, I have marketing, business, and UI/UX design experience. Currently, I am in the process of promoting [Kontest](http://kontest.us/), a collaborative review game website for students and teachers.

In addition to coding, I like to share my knowledge with others and inspire others to learn. I do this by:

* teaching🏫 [computer science at my school](https://compscikids.net/)
* helping organize and lead hackathons💻 - [Teens Take On COVID](https://teens-take-on-covid.devpost.com/) & [Code211](https://code211.org/)
* posting educational content🧮 on [Medium](https://medium.com/@ashayp22) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC-lrzuSt77LJjqa7bOCYjw)
* keeping my software👐 [open-source](https://github.com/ashayp22/)

I am looking for ways to improve my technical and interpersonal skills while contributing to something bigger than myself. Please reach out if such an opportunity exists for me!
