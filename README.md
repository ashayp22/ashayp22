# Who am I?

Hey everyone, I'm a 17 year old high school student that has a passion for learning. Having started my journey 4 years ago, I now develop full-stack apps for web and mobile platforms. Currently, I stopped learning how to develop and apply AI/ML models and have shifted my attention towards learning C++.

In addition to coding, I like to share my knowledge with others and inspire others to learn. I do this by:

* teaching🏫 [computer science at my school](https://compscikids.net/)
* helping organize and lead hackathons💻 - [Teens Take On COVID](https://teens-take-on-covid.devpost.com/) & [Code211](https://code211.org/)
* posting educational content🧮 on [Medium](https://medium.com/@ashayp22) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC-lrzuSt77LJjqa7bOCYjw)
* keeping my software👐 [open-source](https://github.com/ashayp22/)

I am looking for ways to improve my technical and interpersonal skills while contributing to something bigger than myself. Please reach out if such an opportunity exists for me!
