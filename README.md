# Who am I?

Greetingsüññ! I am a student in the B.S. in Computer Science program at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. **My main passion is creating robust, appealing, and reliable software that puts smiles on people's faces.** 

I work with **web and iOS app development** but I have also created **artificial intelligence**, **2D/3D games**, **bots**, and **mathematical/physics simulations**. Outside of the technical domain, I have **marketing** and **UI/UX design** experience.

# Featured Projects

Some of the projects that I am most proud of!

## Social Impact

- [7000 Languages](https://github.com/hack4impact-uiuc/7000-languages) - A mobile application that allows Indigenous communities to develop language learning courses by themselves and learn in published language learning courses.
 
- [3DP4ME](https://uiuc.hack4impact.org/projects/3dp4me) - A website that centralizes 3DP4ME's patient management workflows through a modular dashboard.

- [Open Climate Fix](https://github.com/openclimatefix/pv-sites-mobile) - A frontend web app for solar panel site-level forecasting.

## Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision üß†

- [Recogg](https://github.com/ashayp22/Recogg) - Records classroom/club attendance in seconds using Facial Recognition (AWS), Raspberry Pi, Camera Module, and Web Interface. Created for 7 week summer CS internship in 2020.

- [Word Search Solver](https://github.com/ashayp22/WordSearchSolver) - A website that uses a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and OpenCV to help students solve word search puzzles. Won 2nd place at the district level for the Congressional App Challenge 2019!

- [Calculus Cracker](https://github.com/ashayp22/Calculus-Cracker) - A website that uses Segmentation, Parsing, and a CNN (Keras + OpenCV) trained on a dataset of numbers, letters, and Greek letters to help math students solve handwritten calculus problems. Created as a first semester final project during my HS junior year.

- [Image Captioning](https://github.com/ashayp22/Image-Captioning) - A full deep learning pipeline that generates captions for images using a CNN encoder and RNN decoder (PyTorch).

- [Smart Draw](https://github.com/ashayp22/Smart-Draw) - An iOS game where you try to create drawings that an AI can guess at. If you draw well enough, you earn points! Made using the [Google QuickDraw Dataset](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset) and a Fully Connected Neural Network created using Numpy and SciPy.

## Genetic Algorithms, Neuroevolution üß¨

- [AshayNEAT](https://github.com/ashayp22/AshayNEAT) - My version of the NEAT (neuroevolution of augmenting topologies) algorithm in multiple programming languages. Used to create AI that can beat video games. It has been featured in videos, a hackathon winning project, and AP CS A final project.

- [NeuronRun](https://github.com/ashayp22/NeuroRun) - Uses the Java version of [AshayNEAT](https://github.com/ashayp22/AshayNEAT) to create AI that play [Coolmath's Run Game](https://www.coolmathgames.com/0-run-3).

- [Hoop Swish](https://github.com/ashayp22/Hoop-Swish) - An iOS game where you try to make more basketball shots than your AI opponent. The AI obtains the best shot using a Genetic Algorithm. 

- [The Knapsack Game](https://github.com/ashayp22/The-Knapsack-Game) - An iOS game based on the Knapsack problem (combinatorial optimization). 

## Websites üåê

- [CSK Parent Portal](https://github.com/Comp-Sci-Kids/CSKPortal) - A website that allows parents to register kids for after-school CS tutoring sessions. This is currently in production. Created using React, Node.js, MongoDB, and SQL.

- [COVID-HEAL](https://github.com/ashayp22/COVID-HEAL) - Website for COVID-19 News/Statistics, Face Touching AI, and more. It won "Efficient Remote Working under Remote Working & Education" in the [international EUvsVirus Hackathon 2020](https://www.euvsvirus.org/results/).

- [3D Epicycles](https://github.com/ashayp22/3d-epicycles) - Uses the Discrete Fourier Transform in JavaScript to draw any 3D shape in a matter of seconds. You can draw 3D objects ranging from simple cubes and cones to complex goldfish, ice cream cones, and dragons.

- [Buy or $hort](https://github.com/ashayp22/HackMIT) - Financial Literacy Game created for [HackMIT 2020](http://hackmit.com/), a 36 hour collegiate hackathon hosted by MIT.

- [Connect 4 Minimax](https://github.com/ashayp22/Connect4Minimax) - Play Connect 4 against an AI opponent that determines its moves using the Minimax algorithm. You can adjust a slider to obtain different search levels.

- [Physics Simulations and Games](https://github.com/ashayp22/Physics-Simulations) - These are some physics simulations that I started to create while taking AP Physics 1 and 2 for my classmates. There is a Vector conversion website, Parallel Plates (Electrostatics) simulation, and Right Hand Rule (Magnetism) game.

## Miscellaneous üí°

- [EZ Pantry](https://github.com/EZ-Pantry) - An iOS app that helps food pantries keep track of inventory and serve students and families. Won the [2020 Congressional App Challenge!](https://www.congressionalappchallenge.us/20-IL08)

- [Thin Lines](https://github.com/ashayp22/Thin-Lines) - Fun Graph Theory game available on the iOS app store! Create the thinnest path in a basic graph to stay alive and earn points. Made using Dijkstra's algorithm.

- [Java Projects](https://github.com/ashayp22/Java-Projects-AP-CS-A) - Some of my projects from AP CS A, including a bacteria simulation, rock paper scissors AI, and Hex ([board game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_(board_game))) AI.
