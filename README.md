### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hey everyone, I'm a 17 year old high school student that has a passion for computer science. Having started my journey 4 years ago, I now develop full-stack apps for web and mobile platforms. Currently, I am learning how to develop and apply AI and machine learning models and increase my cloud skills.

In addition to coding, I like to share my knowledge with others and inspire others to learn computer science. I do this by:

* teaching [computer science at my school](https://compscikids.net/)
* helping organize and lead hackathons - [RALLYtoUS](http://rallyto.us/), [Teens Take On COVID](https://teens-take-on-covid.devpost.com/), & [Code211](https://code211.org/)
* posting education content on [Medium](https://medium.com/@ashayp22) and (YouTube)[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC-lrzuSt77LJjqa7bOCYjw]
* keeping my software [open-source](https://github.com/ashayp22/)

I am looking for ways to improve my technical and interpersonal skills while contributing to something bigger than myself. Please reach out if such an opportunity exists for me!
