GreetingsðŸ––! I'm a software engineer focusing on frontend engineering, systems programming, and education. I graduated in May 2024 from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a B.S. in Computer Science and Minor in Math.

At UIUC, I've led teams building impactful, full-stack apps for nonprofits through [Hack4Impact](https://github.com/hack4impact-uiuc) and developed hackathon infrastructure for [HackIllinois](https://github.com/HackIllinois). I've also researched Human-Computer Interaction and survey design and was a Course Assistant for CS 374 (Algorithms & Models of Computation).
