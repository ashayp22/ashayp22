GreetingsðŸ––! I'm a software engineer focusing on frontend engineering, systems programming, and education. I am also in the B.S. in Computer Science program at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

At UIUC, I've led teams building impactful, full-stack apps for nonprofits through [Hack4Impact](https://github.com/hack4impact-uiuc) and developed hackathon infrastructure for [HackIllinois](https://github.com/HackIllinois). I've also researched Human-Computer Interaction and survey design and am a Course Assistant for CS 374 (Algorithms & Models of Computation).
