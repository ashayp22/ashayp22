# Who am I?

Greetingsüññ! I am a first year in the B.S. in Computer Science program at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. **My main passion is creating robust, appealing, and reliable software that puts smiles on people's faces.** 

Currently, I work with **web and iOS app development** but I have also created **artificial intelligence**, **2D/3D games**, **bots**, and **mathematical/physics simulations**. Outside of the technical domain, I have **marketing** and **UI/UX design** experience. Currently, I am in the process of promoting [Kontest](http://kontest.us/), a live, team-based review game website.

In addition to coding, I like to share my knowledge with others and inspire others to learn. I have done this by:

* teachingüè´ [computer science at my school](https://compscikids.net/)
* helping organize and lead hackathonsüíª - [Teens Take On COVID](https://teens-take-on-covid.devpost.com/) & [Code211](https://code211.org/)
* posting educational contentüßÆ with 10k+ views on [Medium](https://medium.com/@ashayp22) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC-lrzuSt77LJjqa7bOCYjw)

# Featured Projects

Some of the projects that I am most proud of!

## Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision üß†

- [Recogg](https://github.com/ashayp22/Recogg) - Records classroom/club attendance in seconds using Facial Recognition (AWS), Raspberry Pi, Camera Module, and Web Interface. Created for 7 week summer CS internship in 2020.

- [Word Search Solver](https://github.com/ashayp22/WordSearchSolver) - A website that uses a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and OpenCV to help students solve word search puzzles. Won 2nd place at the district level for the Congressional App Challenge 2019!

- [Calculus Cracker](https://github.com/ashayp22/Calculus-Cracker) - A website that uses Segmentation, Parsing, and a CNN (Keras + OpenCV) trained on a dataset of numbers, letters, and Greek letters to help math students solve handwritten calculus problems. Created as a first semester final project during my HS junior year.

- [Image Captioning](https://github.com/ashayp22/Image-Captioning) - A full deep learning pipeline that generates captions for images using a CNN encoder and RNN decoder (PyTorch).

- [Smart Draw](https://github.com/ashayp22/Smart-Draw) - An iOS game where you try to create drawings that an AI can guess at. If you draw well enough, you earn points! Made using the [Google QuickDraw Dataset](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset) and a Fully Connected Neural Network created using Numpy and SciPy.

## Genetic Algorithms, Neuroevolution üß¨

- [AshayNEAT](https://github.com/ashayp22/AshayNEAT) - My version of the NEAT (neuroevolution of augmenting topologies) algorithm in multiple programming languages. Used to create AI that can beat video games. It has been featured in videos, a hackathon winning project, and AP CS A final project.

- [NeuronRun](https://github.com/ashayp22/NeuroRun) - Uses the Java version of [AshayNEAT](https://github.com/ashayp22/AshayNEAT) to create AI that play [Coolmath's Run Game](https://www.coolmathgames.com/0-run-3).

- [Hoop Swish](https://github.com/ashayp22/Hoop-Swish) - An iOS game where you try to make more basketball shots than your AI opponent. The AI obtains the best shot using a Genetic Algorithm. 

- [The Knapsack Game](https://github.com/ashayp22/The-Knapsack-Game) - An iOS game based on the Knapsack problem (combinatorial optimization). 

## Websites üåê

- [CSK Parent Portal](https://github.com/Comp-Sci-Kids/CSKPortal) - A website that allows parents to register kids for after-school CS tutoring sessions. This is currently in production. Created using React, Node.js, MongoDB, and SQL.

- [COVID-HEAL](https://github.com/ashayp22/COVID-HEAL) - Website for COVID-19 News/Statistics, Face Touching AI, and more. It won "Efficient Remote Working under Remote Working & Education" in the [international EUvsVirus Hackathon 2020](https://www.euvsvirus.org/results/).

- [3D Epicycles](https://github.com/ashayp22/3d-epicycles) - Uses the Discrete Fourier Transform in JavaScript to draw any 3D shape in a matter of seconds. You can draw 3D objects ranging from simple cubes and cones to complex goldfish, ice cream cones, and dragons.

- [Buy or $hort](https://github.com/ashayp22/HackMIT) - Financial Literacy Game created for [HackMIT 2020](http://hackmit.com/), a 36 hour collegiate hackathon hosted by MIT.

- [Connect 4 Minimax](https://github.com/ashayp22/Connect4Minimax) - Play Connect 4 against an AI opponent that determines its moves using the Minimax algorithm. You can adjust a slider to obtain different search levels.

- [Physics Simulations and Games](https://github.com/ashayp22/Physics-Simulations) - These are some physics simulations that I started to create while taking AP Physics 1 and 2 for my classmates. There is a Vector conversion website, Parallel Plates (Electrostatics) simulation, and Right Hand Rule (Magnetism) game.

## Miscellaneous üí°

- [EZ Pantry](https://github.com/EZ-Pantry) - An iOS app that helps food pantries keep track of inventory and serve students and families. Won the [2020 Congressional App Challenge!](https://www.congressionalappchallenge.us/20-IL08)

- [Thin Lines](https://github.com/ashayp22/Thin-Lines) - Fun Graph Theory game available on the iOS app store! Create the thinnest path in a basic graph to stay alive and earn points. Made using Dijkstra's algorithm.

- [Java Projects](https://github.com/ashayp22/Java-Projects-AP-CS-A) - Some of my projects from AP CS A, including a bacteria simulation, rock paper scissors AI, and Hex ([board game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_(board_game))) AI.

- [Aimbooster Bot](https://github.com/ashayp22/aimboosterbot) - Beat the [Aimbooster](http://www.aimbooster.com/) world record using a Python autoclicker bot.

- [Ace the Maze](https://github.com/ashayp22/Ace-the-Maze) - An interactive Swift Playground that teaches kids about COVID-19 and coding. Created for the [2020 WWDC student challenge](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/06/apples-wwdc20-swift-student-challenge-winners-determined-to-shape-the-future/).
