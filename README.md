# Who am I?

Greetingsüññ! I am a freshman in the B.S. in Computer Science program at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. **My main passion is creating robust, appealing, and reliable software that puts smiles on people's faces.** 

I mainly work with **web development** and **artificial intelligence/machine learning**, but I have also built **iOS apps**, **2D/3D games**, **bots**, and **mathematical/physics simulations**. Outside of the technical domain, I have **marketing** and **UI/UX design** experience. Currently, I am in the process of promoting [Kontest](http://kontest.us/), a collaborative review game website for students and teachers.

In addition to coding, I like to share my knowledge with others and inspire others to learn. I have done this by:

* teachingüè´ [computer science at my school](https://compscikids.net/)
* helping organize and lead hackathonsüíª - [Teens Take On COVID](https://teens-take-on-covid.devpost.com/) & [Code211](https://code211.org/)
* posting educational contentüßÆ on [Medium](https://medium.com/@ashayp22) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC-lrzuSt77LJjqa7bOCYjw)
* keeping my softwareüëê [open-source](https://github.com/ashayp22/)

# Featured Projects

Some of the projects that I am most proud of!

## Deep Learning

- [Recogg](https://github.com/ashayp22/Recogg) - Records classroom/club attendance in seconds using Facial Recognition (AWS), Raspberry Pi, Camera Module, and Web Interface. Created for 7 week summer CS internship in 2020.

- [Word Search Solver](https://github.com/ashayp22/WordSearchSolver) - A website that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (Keras) and OpenCV to solve word search puzzles. Won 2nd place at the district level for the Congressional App Challenge 2019/2020.

- [Calculus Cracker](https://github.com/ashayp22/Calculus-Cracker) - A website that uses Segmentation, Parsing, and a Convolutional Neural Network (Keras + OpenCV) trained on a dataset of numbers, letters, and Greek letters to solve handwritten calculus problems. Created as a first semester final project during my HS junior year.

- [GrinAI](https://github.com/ashayp22/HackSTL-2019) - Detects grins on a human face using a Haar Cascade and Convolutional Neural Network (Keras + OpenCV). Includes a Python Twitter Bot that tweets jokes if a person is not smiling in a picture.

- [Image Captioning](https://github.com/ashayp22/Image-Captioning) - A full deep learning pipeline that generates captions for images using a CNN encoder and RNN decoder (PyTorch). 

- [Predicting Student Performance](https://github.com/ashayp22/Student-Performance-Random-Forest) - Uses a Random Decision Forest to determine if a correlation exists between student/parent activity and student grades.

- [Air Notability](https://github.com/ashayp22/Air-Notability-with-ML) - Uses a Image Processing and a custom Convolutional Neural Network to detects handwritten drawings in the air. 

- [2D SLAM](https://github.com/ashayp22/SLAM) - Implemented SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for a 2 dimensional world. Used for trackign the location of a robot in realtime and identifiying landmarks in its path.

- [Smart Draw](https://github.com/ashayp22/Smart-Draw) - An iOS game where you try to create drawings that an AI can guess at. If you draw well enough, you earn points! Made using the [Google QuickDraw Dataset](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset) and a Fully Connected Neural Network created using Numpy and Scipy.

- [Logistic Regression with MNIST](https://github.com/ashayp22/Logistic-Regression-with-MNIST) - Using logistic regression and python, a classifier for the MNIST database is made. Written using Numpy and Scipy.

# Genetic Algorithms

- [AshayNEAT](https://github.com/ashayp22/AshayNEAT) - My version of the NEAT (neuroevolution of augmenting topologies) algorithm in multiple programming languages. Used to create AI that can beat video games. It has been featured in videos, a hackathon winning project, and AP CS A final project.

- [Traveling Salesman](https://github.com/ashayp22/Traveling-Salesman-Genetic-Algorithm) - Solves a scaled-down version of the Traveling Salesman problem using a Genetic Algorithm.

- [NeuronRun](https://github.com/ashayp22/NeuroRun) - Uses the Java version of [AshayNEAT](https://github.com/ashayp22/AshayNEAT) to create AI that play Coolmath's Run3 Game.

- [Brainy Aliens](https://github.com/ashayp22/Brainy-Aliens) - An iOS game where you try to shoot AI aliens that get better at avoiding you through real-time neuroevolution. 

- [Hoop Swish](https://github.com/ashayp22/Hoop-Swish) - An iOS game where you try to make more basketball shots than your AI opponent. The AI obtains the best shot using a Genetic Algorithm. 

- [The Knapsack Game](https://github.com/ashayp22/The-Knapsack-Game) - An iOS game based on the Knapsack problem (combinatorial optimization). 

# Websites

- [CSK Parent Portal](https://github.com/Comp-Sci-Kids/CSKPortal) - A website that allows parents to register kids for after-school CS tutoring sessions. This is currently in production to 40+ users. 

- [3D Epicycles](https://github.com/ashayp22/3d-epicycles) - Uses the Discrete Fourier Transform and Epicycles to draw any 3D shape in a matter of seconds. You can draw 3D objects ranging from simple cubes and cones to complex goldfish, ice cream cones, and dragons.

- [Buy or $hort](https://github.com/ashayp22/HackMIT) - Financial Literacy Game created for HackMIT 2020, a 36 hour collegiate hackathon.

- [Connect 4 Minimax](https://github.com/ashayp22/Connect4Minimax) - Play Connect 4 against an AI opponent that determines its moves using the Minimax algorithm. You can adjust a slider to obtain different search levels.

- [Physics Simulations and Games](https://github.com/ashayp22/Physics-Simulations) - These are some physics simulations that I started to create while taking AP Physics 1 and 2 for my classmates. There is a Vector conversion website, Parallel Plates (Electrostatics) simulation, and Right Hand Rule (Magnetism) game.

# Miscellaneous

- [Thin Lines](https://github.com/ashayp22/Thin-Lines) - Fun Graphy Theory game available on the iOS app store! Create the thinnest path in a basic graph to stay alive and earn points. Made using Dijkstra's algorithm.

- [Blocky Chase](https://github.com/ashayp22/Blocky-Chase) - iOS A.I. Maze game where you have to solve a maze before the chaser catches you. Made using a Pathfinding algorithm and Growing Tree algorithm.

- [Aimbooster Bot](https://github.com/ashayp22/aimboosterbot) - Beat the [Aimbooster](http://www.aimbooster.com/) world record using a Python autoclicker bot.

- [Ace the Maze](https://github.com/ashayp22/Ace-the-Maze) - An interactive Swift Playground that teaches kids about COVID-19 and coding. Created for the 2020 WWDC student challenge.
