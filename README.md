### Hi there 👋

Hey everyone, I'm a 17 year old high school student😀 that has a passion for learning📖. Having started my journey 4 years ago, I now develop full-stack apps for web🕸️ and mobile📱 platforms. Currently, I am learning how to develop and apply AI/ML🧠 models and increase my cloud☁️ skills.

In addition to coding, I like to share🗣️ my knowledge with others and inspire others to learn. I do this by:

* teaching🏫 [computer science at my school](https://compscikids.net/)
* helping organize and lead hackathons💻 - [RALLYtoUS](http://rallyto.us/), [Teens Take On COVID](https://teens-take-on-covid.devpost.com/), & [Code211](https://code211.org/)
* posting education content🧮 on [Medium](https://medium.com/@ashayp22) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC-lrzuSt77LJjqa7bOCYjw)
* keeping my software👐 [open-source](https://github.com/ashayp22/)

I am looking for ways to improve⬆️ my technical and interpersonal skills while contributing to something bigger than myself🌎. Please reach out if such an opportunity exists for me!
